# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
- **Material Design / Modern Aesthetic:** BookWiki utilizes a clean, structured interface based on Material Design principles. This ensures a familiar, professional, and reliable user experience by leveraging established UI patterns from MUI and Bootstrap.

## Tone and Style
- **Technical and Precise:** The platform communicates using clear, functional, and data-oriented language. This approach respects the user's need for accuracy and structured information management in their worldbuilding projects.

## Design Principles
- **Hierarchical Clarity:** The interface and data models prioritize making complex relationships between narrative elements (characters, locations, items) easy to visualize and navigate.
- **Efficient Data Entry:** Minimizing friction in the creation and organization of content is paramount. The system should facilitate rapid brainstorming and structured documentation through intuitive CRUD flows and flexible section management.
